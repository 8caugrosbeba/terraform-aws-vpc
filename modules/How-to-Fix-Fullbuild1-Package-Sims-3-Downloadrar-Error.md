The "FullBuild1.package" file is one of the game data files that contains graphics, animations, sounds and other resources for The Sims 3. It is usually located in the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\GameData\Shared\Packages" folder. Sometimes, this file can get damaged or deleted due to various reasons, such as incomplete download, faulty disc, antivirus interference, etc.
 
Here are some steps that you can follow to fix the FullBuild1.package error:
 
1. Check your disc for scratches or dirt. If you are installing The Sims 3 from a physical disc, make sure that it is clean and not damaged. You can use a soft cloth to wipe it gently or try another disc drive if possible.
2. Disable your antivirus software temporarily. Some antivirus programs may block or delete some game files during installation. You can try to disable your antivirus software before installing The Sims 3 and enable it again after the installation is complete.
3. Download the file manually. If you are installing The Sims 3 from a digital download, you can try to download the FullBuild1.package file separately from a reliable source and replace the original one in your game folder. You can find some links to download the file in this thread[^1^] or this collection[^3^]. Make sure to backup your original file before replacing it.
4. Repair your game using Origin. If you have installed The Sims 3 through Origin, you can use the repair game option to fix any missing or corrupted files. To do this, open Origin and go to your game library. Right-click on The Sims 3 and select Repair Game. Wait for the process to finish and then try to launch the game.

We hope that these steps helped you fix the FullBuild1.package error and enjoy playing The Sims 3. If you still have any problems or questions, feel free to contact EA customer support or visit their official forums for more help.
  
Another possible cause of the FullBuild1.package error is a conflict with other mods or custom content that you have installed in your game. Mods and custom content are unofficial additions or modifications that can enhance your gameplay experience, but they can also cause problems if they are outdated, incompatible or corrupted.
 
If you have any mods or custom content in your game, you can try to remove them temporarily and see if the error persists. To do this, go to your Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 folder and rename the Mods folder to something else, such as Mods\_old. You can also rename the DCCache folder to DCCache\_old if you have any custom content from the Sims 3 Store or the Exchange. Then, try to launch the game and see if it works.
 
If the game works without any errors, then you can try to add back your mods and custom content one by one and test the game after each addition. This way, you can identify which mod or custom content is causing the problem and either update it, delete it or look for a solution online.
 
However, if the game still does not work even after removing all your mods and custom content, then you may have a more serious issue with your game installation or your system. In that case, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the game completely or contact EA customer support for further assistance.
